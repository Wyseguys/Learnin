Copying the lit starter pack for TypeScript, then reading the TypeScript tooling overview, then getting made at all the shit in the world that has happened in the past 5 years while I've been doing stupid ATO documentation, I got my barebones setup.

1. Create a directory for the project
1. Install NPM
1. Create a tsconfig.json file based on example from typescriptlang.org
1. Replace that safe one with info from the lit ts starter kit
1. Install typescript from NPM (typescript tooling in 5 minutes)
1. Read up on --watch and add that section to the tsconfig.json file
1. Create a package.json for NPM
1. Add the wds/dev-server for NPM
1. Add some 'scripts' in the package.json (I guess these are shortcuts for NPM commands?)
1. run 'npm install' to read the package file and download a bunch of crap
1. Oopsies, better do a .gitignore to ignore the 3+Gb of NPM files
1. Try out the package.json script for build and serve  Both will watch
1. Write up this readme for lucky #13
